                one of the twentieth century’s most potent visions of the future."

                are based on the presence of two men for every woman, leading to novel forms of marriage 
                and family. It is the story of the disparate people, a computer technician, a vigorous 
                young female agitator, and an elderly academic who become the movement's leaders, and of 
                Mike, the supercomputer whose sentience is known only to the revolt's inner circle, who 
                for reasons of his own is committed to the revolution's ultimate success."

                "Oryx and Crake is at once an unforgettable love story and a compelling vision of the future.
                Snowman, known as Jimmy before mankind was overwhelmed by a plague, is struggling to 
                survive in a world where he may be the last human, and mourning the loss of his best friend, 
                Crake, and the beautiful and elusive Oryx whom they both loved. In search of answers, Snowman 
                embarks on a journey–with the help of the green-eyed Children of Crake–through the lush wilderness 
                that was so recently a great city, until powerful corporations took mankind on an uncontrolled
                genetic engineering ride. Margaret Atwood projects us into a near future that is both all too 
                familiar and beyond our imagining."

        <!-- I mention this in the CSS page too but -->
        <p class="tablepreview"> Below are my ratings of the books we have read.
            Note that I am easily entertained.
            I will grade on the scale that a book with a 1 should be burned.
            A 3 is subpar and didn't enjoy.
            A 5 is an average book with nothing wrong with it.
            A 7 would be recommended to a friend.
            A 10 should not be in ever classroom.
